🎯 **Vision**  
Luci isn’t just a product. It’s a shift in how interfaces emerge.  
Crafted not to follow rules — but to understand them, challenge them, and evolve them.  
Quietly intelligent. Endlessly adaptive.

---

🧩 **What Luci _feels_ like**

- It listens before it suggests
- It sketches ideas before you ask
- It aligns with the way you think, not the way you type
- It doesn’t generate — it collaborates

---

🏗️ **Made for builders who think in possibilities**  
Designers, engineers, dreamers — Luci stays with you from the first spark to the final layer.  
This is not a plugin. It’s not a tool.  
It’s your unseen co-creator.

🧬 **Born from LCloud Inc.**  
A product shaped by [lcloud.inc](https://lcloud.inc) — where we build things meant to disappear behind the brilliance of your ideas.
